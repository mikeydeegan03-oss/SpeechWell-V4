# SpeechWell Webhook Server Setup

## Overview
This FastAPI webhook server receives ElevenLabs post-call data and analyzes speech for dysarthria indicators.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
python webhook_server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Test the Server
```bash
# In another terminal
python test_webhook.py
```

## Webhook Endpoints

- **POST** `/webhook/elevenlabs` - Main webhook endpoint for ElevenLabs
- **GET** `/` - Root endpoint (health check)
- **GET** `/health` - Health check endpoint

## Configuration

### Webhook Secret
In `webhook_server.py`, update the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` variable:
```python
WEBHOOK_SECRET = "your_actual_webhook_secret_from_elevenlabs"
```

### ElevenLabs Setup
1. Go to your ElevenLabs dashboard
2. Navigate to Conversational AI settings
3. Set up post-call webhook:
   - URL: `http://your-server.com/webhook/elevenlabs`
   - Enable "Send transcription data"
   - Copy the webhook secret

## Speech Analysis Features

### Dysarthria Indicators Detected:
- **Speech Rate**: Words per minute (normal: 120-160 WPM)
- **Pause Frequency**: Excessive pauses in speech
- **Speech Density**: Words per second
- **Utterance Length**: Very short responses

### Sample Output:
```

## Development Notes

### Security
- HMAC signature verification is implemented but commented out for testing
- Uncomment signature verification lines in production
- Use IP whitelisting for additional security

### Extending Analysis
The `SpeechAnalyzer` class can be extended to include:
- Phoneme analysis
- Breath pattern detection
- Volume consistency
- Articulation scoring

## Production Deployment

### Using ngrok for Testing
```bash
# Install ngrok
# Start your webhook server
python webhook_server.py

# In another terminal
ngrok http 8000

# Use the ngrok URL in ElevenLabs webhook settings
```

### Production Considerations
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set up proper logging
- Enable webhook signature verification
- Add rate limiting
- Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn
